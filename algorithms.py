IDEA:
Large is a sparse graph (1000 nodes with 10000 edges), so we do the following
Get MAXIMAL INDEPENDENT SET (NOT maximum; ideally you would want maximum, but maximum I.S. is NP-C)
Form a team with this maximal independent set
Remove these nodes from consideration when forming the next set
Continuously perform this until we have a fixed number of teams

PSEUDOCODE:
S = {all nodes}
Repeat for i from 1 to k:
    Get maximal independent set I from S
    Form team i with nodes in I
    Remove I from S
